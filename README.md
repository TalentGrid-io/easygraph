## Introduction

This application is designed for create graphql querys.

## Technologies

- React and Next.js for UI, utilising getStaticProps (static generation, fetch data at build time) and getServerSideProps (server-side rendering, fetch data at request time). _next/image_ was used for image optimisation.
- [ApolloJs](https://tailwindcss.com) was used for scale, manage and build with GraphQL.
- [TailwindCss](https://tailwindcss.com) was used for styling.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).
